Hello Codex / ChatGPT,

This is the URL link to her google form that she created for persons to use to register for their classes:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1saARXlZkvXsG8PyDYV49ZnaHxb9FWrZMUwm3JeAjL4NPtA/viewform

The client likes the look of this page:
https://bigblueswimschool.com/

The client also said this (partially referring to the bigblueswimschool website):

"I like the idea of having a ticker tape at the top that can have updates such as if we are closed for a holiday. And generically it can just say Let's go Swimming!

I also like the 3 areas to the bottom that I think could lead to: our approach (the about), our schedule & FAQ and then maybe the third one is the sign up page.

I am hoping to be able to handle any updates myself but if I periodically run into problems hopefully I can pay you to assist as the need arises.

Our logo (J3 swim Fit Logo) is attached and that is the colour scheme I want to work with primarily."
