# J3 Swim Fit Website Starter

This repository contains two static website experiences for the J3 Swim Fit learn-to-swim school located at the Shoppes of Maraval, Trinidad:

- **Single-page experience**: the original landing page that combines programme highlights, schedule snapshots, FAQs, and a registration call-to-action in one scrollable view.
- **Multipage experience**: an alternative build that splits the content across dedicated Home, About, Schedule & FAQ, Contact/Registration, and Blog pages while reusing the same messaging and data.
